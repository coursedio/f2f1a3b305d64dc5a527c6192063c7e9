00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.007
- Another renowned generative AI model

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:05.009
is generative adversarial networks,

3
00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.001
also referred as simply GANs.

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.003
To illustrate how GANs work,

5
00:00:11.003 --> 00:00:14.004
let's give a game of forgery as a metaphor.

6
00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:17.006
Imagine you have an artist called The Generator

7
00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:21.002
who is trying to recreate a painting that is so realistic

8
00:00:21.002 --> 00:00:23.008
that it looks like a famous painting.

9
00:00:23.008 --> 00:00:27.003
And you have another person called The Discriminator

10
00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:30.004
who's an art expert and trying to spot the difference

11
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.007
between the real painting and the forgery.

12
00:00:33.007 --> 00:00:36.003
The Generator creates a painting

13
00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:40.006
and The Discriminator evaluates it, giving feedback

14
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:44.004
to the generator on how to improve the next iteration.

15
00:00:44.004 --> 00:00:47.004
The Generator and The Discriminator

16
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:50.002
played this game repeatedly

17
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:53.005
until The Generator creates the painting that is so

18
00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:57.007
realistic that The Discriminator can't tell the difference

19
00:00:57.007 --> 00:01:00.003
between it and the real painting.

20
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:02.004
In the same way, a GAN model

21
00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:05.004
has a generator and a discriminator.

22
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:09.003
The two parts work together in a competition.

23
00:01:09.003 --> 00:01:14.001
That's why it's called generative adversarial networks.

24
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:17.004
In this way, they improve the generator's ability

25
00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:21.006
to create realistic data, and over time, the generator

26
00:01:21.006 --> 00:01:25.003
becomes better and better at creating realistic data.

27
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:28.009
And the results start yielding in the creation of products,

28
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.000
assets, faces, people, that didn't exist before,

29
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.004
just like we have seen with text-to-image

30
00:01:35.004 --> 00:01:37.007
that we have seen in the former session.

31
00:01:37.007 --> 00:01:41.003
The difference though is that with GANs,

32
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:43.004
you input one type of data,

33
00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:45.008
like pictures or bank transitions,

34
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:49.005
and then you output the same type of data.

35
00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.004
Let's now give three real-world examples

36
00:01:52.004 --> 00:01:53.009
where GANs were used.

37
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.005
We're going to start with Audi.

38
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:57.008
They trained their own GANs

39
00:01:57.008 --> 00:02:01.001
to get inspiration for their wheel designs.

40
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:04.000
This process created lots of different wheel designs

41
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.008
that simply didn't exist before, and gave inspiration

42
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:11.004
to Audi designers so they can pick and choose which designs

43
00:02:11.004 --> 00:02:14.001
they wanted to use in their final decisions.

44
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:17.007
And remember, AI didn't design the final wheel.

45
00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:21.003
AI was simply a tool that the wheel designers used

46
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:24.007
to inspire themselves for the final designs

47
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:26.007
that they would make.

48
00:02:26.007 --> 00:02:31.004
Next, Beko, that is a European-based appliance brand,

49
00:02:31.004 --> 00:02:33.000
they use custom trained GANs

50
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.001
in their sustainability stand film,

51
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.004
which also happens to be the world's first

52
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:41.005
brand-funded AI film created and produced by Seyhan Lee.

53
00:02:41.005 --> 00:02:47.002
We use GANs to generate lightning, leaves, roots, eyes,

54
00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:51.002
flowers, and created seamless transitions to flow

55
00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:53.006
between humans and nature.

56
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:56.009
GANs have this beautiful transitional quality.

57
00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:01.000
And finally, in the context of financial fraud detection,

58
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
GAN models can be used to generate synthetic versions

59
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.006
of fraudulent transactions,

60
00:03:05.006 --> 00:03:10.003
which can then be used to train a fraud detection model.

61
00:03:10.003 --> 00:03:12.000
You know what's really surprising with GANs

62
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is that the same generative AI model can be used

63
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.003
for two very distinct professions.

64
00:03:18.003 --> 00:03:22.008
Here we are seeing some financial fraud detection solving

65
00:03:22.008 --> 00:03:25.006
and create a new tire styles for Audi.

66
00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:28.003
And then later on, the same AI model makes impossibly

67
00:03:28.003 --> 00:03:30.005
beautiful visual effects for film,

68
00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:35.000
and that versatility is the greatest power of GAN models.
