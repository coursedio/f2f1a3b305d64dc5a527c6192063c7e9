00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.000
- When starting to work with generative AI,

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.007
it's imperative that we hold conscious contemplations

3
00:00:06.007 --> 00:00:09.001
for the future of jobs.

4
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.006
As you know, there's a lot of hype at the moment

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:15.001
filled with a lot of Hollywood-powered fear

6
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.008
that machines are now taking over.

7
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:20.003
This is simply not true.

8
00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:21.009
If anyone is taking over,

9
00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.007
it is us humans who are entering in a new golden age

10
00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:28.009
for creativity and production.

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.006
Will there be a shift in the job market?

12
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:35.004
Yeah, absolutely, as it has always been throughout history.

13
00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:38.000
Whenever a new advanced technology is introduced,

14
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.007
it's normal for some jobs to disappear,

15
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.009
while other new ones are introduced.

16
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:44.007
Let's give an example.

17
00:00:44.007 --> 00:00:48.006
Before alarm clocks, there were knocker uppers.

18
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:52.006
These were kids who were hired to knock on the windows

19
00:00:52.006 --> 00:00:54.003
to wake people up.

20
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:58.001
The job obviously disappeared when new job opportunities

21
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.006
for alarm clock manufacturers emerged.

22
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:06.006
The second example would be the switchboard operator jobs.

23
00:01:06.006 --> 00:01:10.002
They disappeared due to the widespread adoption

24
00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:13.003
of automated telephone exchange systems,

25
00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.009
and even though it made jobs disappear,

26
00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.000
automated telephone exchange systems

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.007
revolutionized communication

28
00:01:20.007 --> 00:01:24.000
and connected people all across the world.

29
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.008
What if I were to tell you

30
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:28.003
that there's a very high possibility

31
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:31.005
that certain parts of your job that are repetitive,

32
00:01:31.005 --> 00:01:34.001
dirty, dull, dangerous, or difficult,

33
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:37.003
the four D's, can be automated?

34
00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:40.007
As a result, you will have more time

35
00:01:40.007 --> 00:01:44.003
focusing parts of your skills that are more human-centric,

36
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.006
like creativity, problem solving,

37
00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.000
empathy, and leadership.

38
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.002
Just like the digital revolution in the 90s

39
00:01:53.002 --> 00:01:56.001
gave birth to the emergence of new companies,

40
00:01:56.001 --> 00:01:59.001
we're now witnessing several new endeavors

41
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:01.007
due to the generative AI revolution.

42
00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:04.002
As the co-founder of a generative AI-powered

43
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:07.003
creative company, let me assure you

44
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:11.000
that all our operations are run by humans.

45
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.007
Our company employs developers, cloud architects,

46
00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:17.009
generative AI artists, customer relations,

47
00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.005
project managers, writers, creative directors,

48
00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:23.003
and human producers.

49
00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:26.000
If the Industrial Revolution created jobs

50
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.009
that were robotic for humans,

51
00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:32.002
the Generative AI Revolution will be our liberation

52
00:02:32.002 --> 00:02:34.002
and freedom from them.

53
00:02:34.002 --> 00:02:38.001
Each person will turn into their own creative studio

54
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:41.001
and the barriers between your vision

55
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.007
and its manifestation will disappear.

56
00:02:44.007 --> 00:02:48.004
Complex films, music, writing,

57
00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:50.009
and all forms of creative production tools

58
00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:55.000
will be simplified and given to your fingertips.

59
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.007
Humanity will transcend from a society of consumers

60
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:01.007
to creators.

61
00:03:01.007 --> 00:03:04.007
The ones that excel in the future of job markets

62
00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:07.002
will be those that strengthen

63
00:03:07.002 --> 00:03:10.002
their unique personal emotional skills

64
00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:13.007
that no computer can ever mimic.

65
00:03:13.007 --> 00:03:16.006
My advice would be to start investing

66
00:03:16.006 --> 00:03:19.000
in expanding your consciousness,

67
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.006
start getting to know what makes you unique,

68
00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:27.000
and sharpen your interpersonal, emotional,

69
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.004
and creative skills.
