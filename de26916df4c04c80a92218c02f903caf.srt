00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:04.001
- Generative AI is a type of AI that,

2
00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:07.005
as this name suggests, generates new content.

3
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.003
This is in contrast to other types

4
00:00:09.003 --> 00:00:14.002
of AI, like discriminative AI, which focuses on classifying

5
00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:19.002
or identifying content that is based on preexisting data.

6
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:21.000
Generative AI is often used

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.006
in applications such as image generation,

8
00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:28.005
video synthesis, language generation, and music composition,

9
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:32.001
but to really understand this new tool,

10
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.005
we need to know first where it fits

11
00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.008
in the broader AI landscape.

12
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:41.007
The term AI, which is artificial intelligence,

13
00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.005
is an umbrella term

14
00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:46.009
that encompasses several different subcategories,

15
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:49.002
including generative AI.

16
00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:53.006
These subcategories are used to perform different tasks.

17
00:00:53.006 --> 00:00:56.009
For example, reactive machines are used

18
00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:59.002
in self-driving cars.

19
00:00:59.002 --> 00:01:02.009
Limited memory AI forecasts the weather.

20
00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:07.006
Theory of mind powers virtual customer assistance.

21
00:01:07.006 --> 00:01:11.002
Narrow AI generates customized product suggestions

22
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:13.002
for E-commerce sites.

23
00:01:13.002 --> 00:01:16.002
Supervised learning identifies objects

24
00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:19.005
from things like images and video.

25
00:01:19.005 --> 00:01:21.009
Unsupervised learning can detect

26
00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.000
fraudulent bank transactions, and reinforcement learning

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.001
can teach a machine how to play a game.

28
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.005
These are only a few of the subcategories,

29
00:01:32.005 --> 00:01:36.002
and generative AI models fall into a lot

30
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:40.002
of these categories, and honestly, it's only growing.

31
00:01:40.002 --> 00:01:44.005
These other types of AI may still generate content,

32
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:48.009
but they do it as a side effect of their primary function.

33
00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.000
Generative AI is specifically designed

34
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.003
to generate new content as its primary output.

35
00:01:56.003 --> 00:02:01.003
Whether this is text, images, product suggestions, whatever,

36
00:02:01.003 --> 00:02:04.004
that's what generative AI is designed to do.

37
00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:07.006
So, now that we know where generative AI fits

38
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:10.002
in the broader landscape, together,

39
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:12.000
let's explore how it works.
