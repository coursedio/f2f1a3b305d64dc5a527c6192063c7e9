00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:02.003
- During this part of the course,

2
00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:05.004
we will be getting more familiar with some

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:08.009
of the most well-known types of generative AI models,

4
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.008
and some of the applications they cover.

5
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:13.006
Think of generative AI models,

6
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:16.006
let's use the metaphor, food.

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:18.001
Under the term food,

8
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:23.005
you find salads, soups, caviar, stews, fresh vegetables,

9
00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:25.006
and just like food,

10
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:28.009
under the umbrella term of generative AI,

11
00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.004
you find several options

12
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.006
depending on what you are craving for.

13
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.007
So this isn't meant to be an exhaustive list

14
00:00:36.007 --> 00:00:40.009
of all the applications and all the models,

15
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.003
but think of it more like a guide

16
00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:46.002
to the generative AI landscape

17
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:48.002
and how you can make use of it.

18
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:49.007
But keep in mind

19
00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:53.000
that this landscape is changing dramatically

20
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.006
every single day.

21
00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:56.001
And there's a very good chance

22
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:57.009
that when you're watching this course,

23
00:00:57.009 --> 00:01:00.008
there will be lots and lots of new players, models,

24
00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.005
and applications already born.

25
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.003
But that's what makes it so exciting.

26
00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:09.006
So let's start exploring some of the main models together.
