00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.001
- Natural language generation

2
00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:05.004
is perhaps the most well-known application

3
00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:09.009
of generative AI so far with ChatGPT in the headlines.

4
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.007
Most of the hype around text-based generative AI

5
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.000
is using a model called GPT.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.001
GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer.

7
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:23.001
It's a language model developed by OpenAI,

8
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.008
a research organization focused on developing

9
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:27.008
and promoting friendly AI.

10
00:00:27.008 --> 00:00:31.000
The idea of pre-training a language model

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.005
and finding it on a task-specific dataset

12
00:00:33.005 --> 00:00:35.001
isn't something new.

13
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.007
This concept has been around for decades

14
00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:41.004
and has been used in several other models before GPT.

15
00:00:41.004 --> 00:00:46.003
However, GPT has become notable for its large scale

16
00:00:46.003 --> 00:00:48.006
use of transformer architecture

17
00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:52.007
and its ability to generate human-like texts,

18
00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:55.009
which had led to its widespread use

19
00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:59.008
and popularity in the field of natural language processing.

20
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.005
Imagine you have a writing assistant

21
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:06.009
that can help you write emails, articles, even a novel.

22
00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.009
GPT can take in a prompt, like a topic or a sentence,

23
00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.009
and can generate text based on that prompt.

24
00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.009
It can even continue a story

25
00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.008
or a conversation you started earlier.

26
00:01:19.008 --> 00:01:22.002
Here are a few industry applications.

27
00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:23.007
Let's start with GitHub.

28
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:27.001
GitHub Copilot is a generative AI service

29
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.006
provided by GitHub to its users.

30
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:33.009
The service uses the OpenAI codex to suggest the code

31
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.005
and entire functions in real time,

32
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.003
right from the code editor.

33
00:01:38.003 --> 00:01:43.000
It allows the users to search less for outside solutions

34
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.001
and it also helps them type less

35
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.005
with smarter code completion.

36
00:01:47.005 --> 00:01:51.000
Another example would be Microsoft's Bing,

37
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.002
which implemented ChatGPT into its search functionality,

38
00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:58.001
enabling it to reach concise information

39
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.005
in a shorter amount of time.

40
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:03.008
Since OpenAI made ChatGPT available to the public

41
00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:09.002
on November 30th in 2022, it reached 1 million user

42
00:02:09.002 --> 00:02:13.005
in less than a week, I said in less than a week.

43
00:02:13.005 --> 00:02:16.001
Now, let's compare that to other companies

44
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:18.006
that hit 1 million users.

45
00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:23.006
It took Netflix 49 months to reach 1 million users.

46
00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:28.003
It took Twitter 24 months, it took Airbnb 30 months,

47
00:02:28.003 --> 00:02:30.001
Facebook, 10 months,

48
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.007
and it took Instagram two-and-a half-months

49
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:35.000
to reach 1 million users.

50
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.009
Let's remember, it took ChatGPT only one week.

51
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.001
These figures demonstrate how easily humans

52
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.006
adopted their workflow for co-creating

53
00:02:44.006 --> 00:02:46.005
with generative AI-based tools and services.

54
00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:48.004
This is amazing.

55
00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:51.006
However, GPT has several limitations,

56
00:02:51.006 --> 00:02:55.004
such as the lack of common sense, creativity

57
00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:57.007
and understanding the text it generates.

58
00:02:57.007 --> 00:03:02.001
Also, bias data sets and the danger of normalization

59
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:05.009
of mediocrity when we come up with creative writing.

60
00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:07.004
Natural language models

61
00:03:07.004 --> 00:03:09.009
synthetically mimic human capabilities,

62
00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:14.007
but, clearly, conscious contemplations are required

63
00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:17.006
before developing generative AI tools.

64
00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:21.009
ChatGPT is a wonderful tool for factual

65
00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:24.002
and computable information.

66
00:03:24.002 --> 00:03:28.002
However, I would advise us to approach it with caution

67
00:03:28.002 --> 00:03:32.001
when inquiring about creative and opinion-based writing.
