00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:02.008
- I want to round out this course

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.004
with a controversial statement.

3
00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:10.009
The greatest bias in AI is not race,

4
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.001
is not ethnicity, nor gender.

5
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.003
It is human's inferiority complex.

6
00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:21.003
If we see machines as superior to humans,

7
00:00:21.003 --> 00:00:23.003
we place them on a pedestal,

8
00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.006
and if we see humans

9
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:27.004
as incapable fragile beings,

10
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:30.006
we again place AI on a pedestal,

11
00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:34.006
but this time with the power of an authority.

12
00:00:34.006 --> 00:00:39.000
We should always emphasize the crucial and essential role

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.002
of human creativity and decision-making in the process.

14
00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:48.007
Nowadays, popular headlines suggest that AI is designing,

15
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.002
AI is coding,

16
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:54.002
but let's remember, it's humans who wrote the algorithms

17
00:00:54.002 --> 00:00:57.006
for AI, and it's humans who conceptualize, curate,

18
00:00:57.006 --> 00:01:01.007
and oversee the algorithms to produce the desired outcomes.

19
00:01:01.007 --> 00:01:04.002
If we place AI and technology at the center

20
00:01:04.002 --> 00:01:05.008
of our workflow in storytelling,

21
00:01:05.008 --> 00:01:09.005
we risk dehumanizing ourselves and contributing

22
00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:13.004
to a future where human jobs may really be eliminated.

23
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.004
Instead, we should focus on highlighting

24
00:01:16.004 --> 00:01:18.006
the central role that humans play

25
00:01:18.006 --> 00:01:22.001
in the creation and the use of AI.

26
00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:23.009
I know even though sentences

27
00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.008
such as like, "AI made this art,

28
00:01:25.008 --> 00:01:27.003
and, "AI is advancing quickly,

29
00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:30.005
AI is so cool," are common in the collective,

30
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:32.003
we should strive to correct ourselves

31
00:01:32.003 --> 00:01:36.005
in centering our actions and self-expression around humans.

32
00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:39.000
It is humans that are making art

33
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.009
by using generative AI-powered tools, and it is,

34
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.008
again, humans that are working in tandem with each other

35
00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:49.008
to advance several different human-benefiting technologies,

36
00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.005
including generative AI.

37
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:55.005
By modeling our tools after ourselves,

38
00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:59.000
we are inevitably transferring our own judgments,

39
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.005
our own insecurities,

40
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:04.002
and our own limitations onto this technology.

41
00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:06.000
So it is essential

42
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.006
that we work to overcome our own insecurities

43
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:12.007
and approach AI as a tool that can augment

44
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:18.002
and empower us, rather than compete or replace us.

45
00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:22.007
By doing so, we can create AI systems that contribute

46
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:25.003
to the elation of humanity,

47
00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:28.000
assist us with creative productivity,

48
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and help us achieve our greatest potential as a species.
