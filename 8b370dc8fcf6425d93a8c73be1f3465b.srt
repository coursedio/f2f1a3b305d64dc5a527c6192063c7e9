00:00:00.002 --> 00:00:03.004
- Generative AI is changing how we create.

00:00:03.004 --> 00:00:07.006
(light music)

3
00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:09.006
For the first time,

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:11.006
humans are supervising

5
00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:14.000
and machines are generating.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.006
It's helping us lift the dirty, dull,

7
00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:20.007
dangerous and difficult tasks from humanity's shoulders

8
00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.009
so then we can simply focus on the very essence

9
00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.001
of our work,

10
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.006
the vision, the idea, and the purpose.

11
00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:34.001
It's a complete paradigm shift for the future of jobs.

12
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:38.000
I am Pinar Seyhan Demirdag and I'm the co-founder

13
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.008
and the AI director of Seyhan Lee.

14
00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:42.005
During this LinkedIn Learning course,

15
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:46.002
we will talk about how to use that tool

16
00:00:46.002 --> 00:00:50.009
to drive the creation of your intention.

17
00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:53.007
Join me as we dive deep

18
00:00:53.007 --> 00:00:57.008
into this new creative revolution that I'm so excited about

19
00:00:57.008 --> 00:00:59.004
and let's discover together

20
00:00:59.004 --> 00:01:02.005
how each of us can have a place

21
00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.006
in this age of advanced technologies.
