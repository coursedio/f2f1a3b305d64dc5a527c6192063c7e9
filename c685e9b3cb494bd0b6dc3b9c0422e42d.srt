00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.009
- So now that we have our generative AI model

2
00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:05.006
and our chassis,

3
00:00:05.006 --> 00:00:08.006
we are ready to create our own content.

4
00:00:08.006 --> 00:00:10.002
If we're a beginner,

5
00:00:10.002 --> 00:00:13.009
we can use a paid service like Midjourney or Lensa.

6
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.008
If we are more experienced,

7
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:20.000
we can use a notebook and pick from available models.

8
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.008
If you download a commercial app

9
00:00:21.008 --> 00:00:25.002
and upload only 10 pictures of yourself, like I did,

10
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.007
the app suggests a variety of different avatars of yourself.

11
00:00:28.007 --> 00:00:30.007
It's super fun.

12
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.004
If you are a more experienced generative AI user,

13
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.006
a creative technologist, you can go to GitHub,

14
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:38.009
choose your favorite generative AI model,

15
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.000
and see if it is available in the form of a notebook.

16
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
If it's not available, you can still inquire about it

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.004
inside the generative AI community.

18
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.007
They're super friendly people.

19
00:00:48.007 --> 00:00:50.005
And if you are a programmer,

20
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:52.002
you can also create your own notebook

21
00:00:52.002 --> 00:00:54.008
by taking the model code from GitHub.

22
00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:56.001
For a demonstration,

23
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.007
we will be running a Google Colab notebook named Deforum,

24
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:01.009
that is based on stable diffusion,

25
00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:04.003
to generate a fantasy landscape.

26
00:01:04.003 --> 00:01:08.000
As you can see here, the notebook runs through the code,

27
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.009
and depending on your settings,

28
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.008
produces a personalized outcome.

29
00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:15.000
Google Colab requires a subscription.

30
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.003
If you would like your generation time to be minimized

31
00:01:18.003 --> 00:01:21.002
you need to buy a paid subscription.

32
00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:24.008
These notebooks offer a lot of personalized options

33
00:01:24.008 --> 00:01:27.000
for the quality of your outcomes.

34
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.007
You can always choose the default generation,

35
00:01:29.007 --> 00:01:32.000
but the beauty of working with a notebook

36
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.004
is that you can tweak and personalize the outcomes.

37
00:01:36.004 --> 00:01:41.000
In summary, a model is a set of algorithms

38
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.005
that have been trained on a specific dataset.

39
00:01:44.005 --> 00:01:49.001
A notebook is a tool for writing and running the code.

40
00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.006
A creative application is an example

41
00:01:51.006 --> 00:01:54.000
of how a model can be used,

42
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.001
and the generated outcome is what the end user produces

43
00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:00.005
by using a generative AI service

44
00:02:00.005 --> 00:02:04.001
or a notebook that houses the model inside it.
