00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.001
- Now that we completed this course,

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.001
what are we going to do next?

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:08.002
There's only one way to go from here.

4
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.007
We choose to overcome all fear, judgment,

5
00:00:11.007 --> 00:00:14.000
and prejudice around AI.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.009
I understand.

7
00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.001
I genuinely, wholeheartedly understand

8
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.004
and empathize with you

9
00:00:19.004 --> 00:00:22.001
with all the confusion people have around AI.

10
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.006
"AI is going to take my job."

11
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.002
"It's going to replace me."

12
00:00:26.002 --> 00:00:30.002
"What will I become if AI starts doing my job?"

13
00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:33.006
These are, I understand prevailing fears

14
00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:36.001
that I hear around me all the time,

15
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.009
but next time that we're confused with AI

16
00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:42.000
let's always get back to the basics

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.009
and remember that AI is nothing but a tool

18
00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:50.000
in the service of humanity, in the service of you.

19
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.003
The best way to overcome fear is to broaden our perspective.

20
00:00:54.003 --> 00:00:56.006
And how are we going to do that?

21
00:00:56.006 --> 00:00:59.008
Let's start with doing our own research.

22
00:00:59.008 --> 00:01:02.000
We can research further after discourse

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.002
about AI and the power of humanity.

24
00:01:05.002 --> 00:01:07.004
We can think about what makes humans different

25
00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:08.007
than the machine

26
00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:12.005
and how can we strengthen these capabilities.

27
00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:16.001
Second, to start making things today now.

28
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.000
As we have seen during the course,

29
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.001
you don't need to have a technical understanding

30
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.003
of generative AI to start working with it.

31
00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:25.005
Like I'm the co-founder of a company

32
00:01:25.005 --> 00:01:27.005
that uses generative AI,

33
00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.006
and still to this day I haven't written

34
00:01:29.006 --> 00:01:31.006
a single line of code.

35
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:33.009
And finally, stay creative.

36
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.003
The biggest challenge that awaits us in the future

37
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:40.008
will be overcoming the normalization of mediocrity.

38
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:43.005
Generative AI is great, yeah, it's awesome

39
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:46.006
but it's simply a tool, like we said before.

40
00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:50.007
It's like camera that works the same way over and over

41
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:52.005
when you use it.

42
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:55.008
If we become lazy and start relying on the machines

43
00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:58.008
for the production of content and assets

44
00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:00.008
without staying creative,

45
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:03.001
we will be receiving outcomes

46
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:07.003
that are devoid of the sparkle of human ingenuity.

47
00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:09.008
This is a very fast moving field.

48
00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:13.002
Like my AI Director friend, John Finger, says,

49
00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:17.003
"We live in the time of cutting edge obsolescence."

50
00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.001
Even though generative AI may be one

51
00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:21.006
of the most advanced technologies out there,

52
00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:24.000
it's exponential development means that just

53
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.003
because you know how things work one week

54
00:02:26.003 --> 00:02:30.005
you can simply completely be obsolete the next.

55
00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:33.003
For this, I would like to share with you

56
00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.006
all the resources I surround myself

57
00:02:35.006 --> 00:02:38.002
for my daily dose of generative AI

58
00:02:38.002 --> 00:02:40.006
to make sure that you don't miss a beat.

59
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:43.002
Thank you wholeheartedly for listening to me

60
00:02:43.002 --> 00:02:45.003
and joining me in this course.

61
00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:47.004
And I leave you with this.

62
00:02:47.004 --> 00:02:52.001
Always remember that you are the power behind AI.
