1
00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:02.008
- To understand how generative AI works,

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.001
we first have to understand how it comes to life.

3
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:07.005
I know how you're feeling.

4
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.009
You're looking at the news, and ChatGPT, and Midjourney,

5
00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.006
all this generative, what is generative, what is AI?

6
00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:15.001
It's so complicated.

7
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.007
You have no idea how to make sense of it all,

8
00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:19.002
but you know you need to,

9
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:22.000
because this is where the world is evolving towards.

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.007
Okay, let's start with AI 101.

11
00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:27.004
Imagine you and me were having dinner

12
00:00:27.004 --> 00:00:30.003
and you asked me to pass you the salt.

13
00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:33.009
I look at the table and I can make a discernment

14
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:36.009
between a salt shaker and the rest of the objects

15
00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:38.001
on the table.

16
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.002
Why?

17
00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:42.001
Because my mind has been trained with thousands,

18
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:46.009
or millions, or trillions of salt shakers earlier.

19
00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.002
AI works the same.

20
00:00:48.002 --> 00:00:51.006
You feed it with thousands, millions, trillions of content,

21
00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.008
and then you teach a certain algorithm

22
00:00:53.008 --> 00:00:57.005
to generate outputs and solutions as a result.

23
00:00:57.005 --> 00:01:01.002
Okay, now that we got AI 101 out of the way,

24
00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:04.006
let's get into generative AI 101.

25
00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.003
Let's use cars as an example.

26
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:11.002
Just like a Porsche has a different engine than a Mazda,

27
00:01:11.002 --> 00:01:14.002
under the umbrella term of generative AI,

28
00:01:14.002 --> 00:01:18.001
there are a variety of different generative AI models.

29
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.003
These AI models, or car engines,

30
00:01:21.003 --> 00:01:23.007
are written and manufactured by groups

31
00:01:23.007 --> 00:01:27.002
of highly advanced computer vision specialists,

32
00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:30.004
machine learning experts, and mathematicians.

33
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:32.006
They're built on years of open source

34
00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.002
machine learning research and generally funded

35
00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:37.004
by companies and universities.

36
00:01:37.004 --> 00:01:39.004
Some of the big players in writing

37
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:42.005
these generative AI models, engines,

38
00:01:42.005 --> 00:01:46.001
are Open AI, NVIDIA, Google, Meta,

39
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:50.008
and universities like UC Berkeley and LMU Munich.

40
00:01:50.008 --> 00:01:53.005
They can either keep these models private,

41
00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.005
or they can make them public, what we call this,

42
00:01:56.005 --> 00:02:00.008
open source, for those to benefit from their research.

43
00:02:00.008 --> 00:02:04.001
All right, now that these complex generative models

44
00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:07.006
are written, meaning the engines are made,

45
00:02:07.006 --> 00:02:09.007
what are we going to do with them?

46
00:02:09.007 --> 00:02:12.007
Depending on your level of technical expertise,

47
00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:14.005
this can look a bit different.

48
00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.004
I'm going to paint a picture for you

49
00:02:16.004 --> 00:02:19.005
with three different end users of these models.

50
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:22.003
The first person is a business leader

51
00:02:22.003 --> 00:02:24.005
who comes up with a product idea

52
00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:28.006
that involves a generative AI model, or several.

53
00:02:28.006 --> 00:02:30.008
For the development of their tool,

54
00:02:30.008 --> 00:02:34.000
this business leader either uses free open source

55
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.009
generative AI models or enters into a partnership

56
00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.006
with a corporation to get rights

57
00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:42.006
to their generative AI model,

58
00:02:42.006 --> 00:02:45.002
then their team creates their vision.

59
00:02:45.002 --> 00:02:47.001
To continue the chronology,

60
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:50.004
let's say this person owns the car factory.

61
00:02:50.004 --> 00:02:53.008
They direct where the engine and chassis go,

62
00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:56.004
but don't actually work on the floor.

63
00:02:56.004 --> 00:02:59.005
The second person is a creative person

64
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:02.001
with an appetite for adventure.

65
00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.004
They might have some technical knowledge,

66
00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:06.006
but they aren't an AI engineer.

67
00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.009
I mean, they can be if they want.

68
00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:12.003
This person goes to a car engine showroom,

69
00:03:12.003 --> 00:03:16.004
where they pick a pre-made car engine

70
00:03:16.004 --> 00:03:20.001
or a generative AI model from a repository

71
00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:22.009
like GitHub and Hugging Face.

72
00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:26.004
After that, they go to a chassis manufacturer

73
00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:30.000
to pick their empty shell for their new engine,

74
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.008
their precious new engine.

75
00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:34.007
These chassis are called AI notebooks.

76
00:03:34.007 --> 00:03:38.006
Their purpose is to hold and run

77
00:03:38.006 --> 00:03:41.004
the generative AI model code.

78
00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:44.006
The most widely used one is Google Colab,

79
00:03:44.006 --> 00:03:47.005
but there are others like Jupiter Notebooks.

80
00:03:47.005 --> 00:03:51.003
And the third person would be my mother, bless her heart.

81
00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:54.001
She has absolutely no technical pedigree,

82
00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:56.006
nor she's interested in acquiring one.

83
00:03:56.006 --> 00:04:01.000
But this doesn't mean she cannot benefit from generative AI.

84
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.007
My mother would be buying her already made car.

85
00:04:04.007 --> 00:04:09.001
She will have way less control over the outcome of her car,

86
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:12.002
but she will be able to drive, just like the business leader

87
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:14.006
and the creative technologist.

88
00:04:14.006 --> 00:04:18.000
People with no technical knowledge can simply subscribe

89
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.009
to an online service like OpenAI's ChatGPT or DALL-E,

90
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.004
or download Discord and play with Midjourney,

91
00:04:25.004 --> 00:04:29.004
or download Lensa AI and Avatar Maker in their smartphone

92
00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:32.005
to play with the magic of generative AI.

93
00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:35.001
Well, this all depends what you want to do

94
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:36.007
and what you want to build,

95
00:04:36.007 --> 00:04:39.009
and how much technical expertise you already have.

96
00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.009
Now that we have our car, our generative AI model,

97
00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.007
we can now start creating our own content

98
00:04:46.007 --> 00:04:48.001
and go for a drive.
