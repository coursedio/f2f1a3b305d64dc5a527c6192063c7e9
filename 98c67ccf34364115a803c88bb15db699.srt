00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.005
- Any executive or business leader

2
00:00:03.005 --> 00:00:07.007
should approach generative AI tools with caution.

3
00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:10.004
We should at all times self-monitor

4
00:00:10.004 --> 00:00:13.008
and self-question if the generated results

5
00:00:13.008 --> 00:00:17.008
fits our quality and satisfaction parameters.

6
00:00:17.008 --> 00:00:21.000
Just because ChatGPT generates headlines,

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.007
it doesn't mean that what it makes is great.

8
00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:26.000
Or just because we can generate a landscape

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.007
with Stable Diffusion,

10
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:30.009
it doesn't mean it's ready for the final pixel of a movie.

11
00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.000
During this grace period

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.005
where we learn to co-create with algorithms,

13
00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:41.008
it's crucial that we deepen our executive skills.

14
00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:44.008
If we are a founder or an executive

15
00:00:44.008 --> 00:00:47.000
in a generative AI company,

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we shall, at all times,

17
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.007
always ask ourselves who is benefiting from our tools?

18
00:00:54.007 --> 00:00:59.007
Our moral compass should always direct towards transparency,

19
00:00:59.007 --> 00:01:03.006
fairness, empathy, and responsibility.

20
00:01:03.006 --> 00:01:08.002
I highly recommend organizing a board or a council

21
00:01:08.002 --> 00:01:12.006
at your organization that acts like the ethical foundation

22
00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:15.006
for the integration of generative ai.

23
00:01:15.006 --> 00:01:19.002
Provide, please, all your employees with ethical guidance

24
00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:24.000
and education on how to use generative AI effectively,

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.009
and also how to overcome their fears, challenges, and biases

26
00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.003
towards this new advanced tool.

27
00:01:31.003 --> 00:01:33.008
As the technology continues to evolve,

28
00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:36.000
it's very likely that the distinction

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.004
between human and algorithm-generated content

30
00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.008
will become increasingly blurred,

31
00:01:41.008 --> 00:01:44.003
and it will become even more important

32
00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:47.008
for leaders like you to have a clear understanding

33
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:50.007
of the role of each.

34
00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:54.005
We will remain in control of AI by always positioning

35
00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.006
the human consciousness in the very center

36
00:01:57.006 --> 00:02:01.002
of generative AI companies and solutions.

37
00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:04.003
Especially in our organizations,

38
00:02:04.003 --> 00:02:09.009
we must ensure that humans remain the sole decision makers.

39
00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.002
In this way, we will be setting the objectives

40
00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:19.004
and determine the direction of AI-generated content.

41
00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:22.007
By keeping humans at the very center,

42
00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:24.007
we can ensure that the content produced

43
00:02:24.007 --> 00:02:29.004
by generative AI aligns with your company values and goals,

44
00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:33.000
which have to do with serving the elation

45
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.007
and elevation of humanity.

46
00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:39.004
By actively engaging with generative AI technology

47
00:02:39.004 --> 00:02:43.001
and developing a deep understanding of its capabilities

48
00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:46.004
and limitations all across your team,

49
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:49.001
we can avoid the potential risks

50
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:52.005
associated with blindly relying on AI

51
00:02:52.005 --> 00:02:54.009
to make decisions for us.

52
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:59.007
Well, ultimately, the goal is to strike a beautiful balance

53
00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:02.008
between leveraging the power of generative AI

54
00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:06.003
to enhance human creativity and imagination,

55
00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:08.006
and optimizing production,

56
00:03:08.006 --> 00:03:13.002
while also maintaining human control and oversight

57
00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:15.001
over this advanced technology.
