00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:03.002
- Let's now move to talking about an application

2
00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:06.005
of generative AI that may not be as obvious

3
00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.004
as it's used in generating images,

4
00:00:08.004 --> 00:00:11.009
like we have seen earlier, audio or text.

5
00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:15.001
But it's still very important application nonetheless,

6
00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.009
and it is going to be the anomaly detection.

7
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.000
One of the main models that we use

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.006
in this space is Variational Autoencoders,

9
00:00:24.006 --> 00:00:26.005
referred as VAE.

10
00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.009
These models can be used for anomaly detection

11
00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.009
by training the model on a dataset of normal data,

12
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.009
and then using the trained model to identify instances

13
00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:40.007
that deviate from the normal data.

14
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:42.009
This can be used to detect anomalies

15
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:46.004
in a wide range of situations, like finding fraud

16
00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:50.005
in financial transactions, spotting flaws in manufacturing

17
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.004
or finding security breaches in a network.

18
00:00:53.004 --> 00:00:57.002
For example, Uber has used VAE for anomaly detection

19
00:00:57.002 --> 00:01:00.003
in their financial transactions to detect fraud.

20
00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.005
Another example would be Google has also used VAE

21
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:07.005
to detect network intrusions using anomaly detection

22
00:01:07.005 --> 00:01:11.001
and another one of a real world application of VAE

23
00:01:11.001 --> 00:01:15.001
would be anomaly detection in industrial quality control.

24
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.008
In this scenario, a VAE can be trained

25
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:21.008
on a dataset of images of normal products

26
00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:24.006
and then used to identify images of products

27
00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:27.006
that deviate from the normal data.

28
00:01:27.006 --> 00:01:30.005
In this way, it can be used to detect defects

29
00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:34.009
in products such as scratches, dents, or misalignments.

30
00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.008
Another real world example would be healthcare

31
00:01:37.008 --> 00:01:40.008
where VAE is used to detect anomalies

32
00:01:40.008 --> 00:01:44.006
in medical imaging such as CT scans and MRI,

33
00:01:44.006 --> 00:01:48.000
like Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC

34
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.009
uses a generative AI model

35
00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.005
to analyze electronic health records.

36
00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:56.007
The model uses data such as vital signs, laboratory results

37
00:01:56.007 --> 00:02:00.002
and demographic information to predict which patients

38
00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:02.001
are at risk of sepsis,

39
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.003
allowing healthcare providers to intervene early

40
00:02:05.003 --> 00:02:07.008
and improve patient outcomes.

41
00:02:07.008 --> 00:02:10.009
Variational Autoencoders are a flexible,

42
00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.005
generative model that are not only able to detect anomalies

43
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:18.003
but are also a part of the architecture

44
00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:21.002
of several other generative AI models.
