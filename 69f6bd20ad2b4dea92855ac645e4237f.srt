00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.008
- The best way to predict the future,

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:07.005
as they say, is to invent it so let's talk about the future.

3
00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:10.000
In two to three years in the gaming,

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.007
film and marketing sectors generative AI

5
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:15.008
will continue to be used in computer graphics,

6
00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:18.005
and animation to create more realistic,

7
00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:21.000
and believable characters, and environments.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.006
This is going to be particularly important in 3D modeling.

9
00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:27.007
Generative AI will be used to improve

10
00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:30.007
natural language understanding in virtual assistants

11
00:00:30.007 --> 00:00:33.009
and chatbots making them more and more capable

12
00:00:33.009 --> 00:00:37.008
of handling complex and nuanced conversations.

13
00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:40.009
In the energy sector, generative AI models

14
00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.004
will be used to optimize energy consumption

15
00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:46.005
and production, such as predicting demand,

16
00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:51.003
and managing renewable energy sources, as well as improving

17
00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:55.000
the efficiency of energy distribution networks.

18
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.004
As for the transportation sector, generative AI models

19
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:00.007
will be used to optimize traffic flow

20
00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:04.004
and to predict maintenance needs for vehicles.

21
00:01:04.004 --> 00:01:07.007
In short, generative AI will be used

22
00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:12.003
to automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency

23
00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:15.001
in a wide variety of industries.

24
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.008
My predictions for the next 10 to 15 years

25
00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.006
would be generative AI will be used to create

26
00:01:20.006 --> 00:01:24.007
more and realistic, and accurate simulations in fields

27
00:01:24.007 --> 00:01:28.003
such as architecture, urban planning, and engineering.

28
00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.007
The second would be to be used to create

29
00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:33.002
new materials and products in fields,

30
00:01:33.002 --> 00:01:36.002
such as manufacturing and textile design.

31
00:01:36.002 --> 00:01:38.009
The third will be natural language generation

32
00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.009
will be improved in the fields of content creation

33
00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.006
such as news articles, books, and even movie scripts.

34
00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:48.000
It will also improve self-driving cars

35
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.005
by generating realistic virtual scenarios

36
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:54.002
for testing and training, and also it will excel

37
00:01:54.002 --> 00:01:59.000
in audio to asset generation where you can speak,

38
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.005
and then have the AI generate an asset.

39
00:02:02.005 --> 00:02:05.001
In short, my prediction for the upcoming

40
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:08.000
10 to 15 years would be generative AI

41
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.008
will be used in the creation and production

42
00:02:10.008 --> 00:02:14.004
of mass media quality books, films, and games.

43
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:17.001
Meanwhile, it will also be the technology

44
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:19.005
behind paradigm shifting implications

45
00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:23.001
in the job market, such as self-driving cars,

46
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:27.002
advanced robotics for manufacturing, and for warehousing,

47
00:02:27.002 --> 00:02:31.005
and improved crop yield and precision agriculture.
