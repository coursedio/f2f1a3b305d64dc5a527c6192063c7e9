00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:03.003
- The advent of generative AI can be likened

2
00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:06.006
to the invention of photography and celluloid film,

3
00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.006
a true creative revolution.

4
00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:12.005
With photography, we no longer needed to rely

5
00:00:12.005 --> 00:00:16.005
on the interpretation of an artist to capture reality,

6
00:00:16.005 --> 00:00:18.000
and with generative AI,

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.002
we no longer need artistic talent to draw or to sing.

8
00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:24.004
We can access now concise information

9
00:00:24.004 --> 00:00:27.000
in just a manner of seconds.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.002
We can also automatically generate text

11
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.001
such as news articles or product descriptions.

12
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.006
We can even design custom products like shoes or furniture.

13
00:00:36.006 --> 00:00:40.006
We can produce music, speech, visual effects,

14
00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:44.005
3D assets and sound effects using algorithms trained

15
00:00:44.005 --> 00:00:46.008
on already existing data.

16
00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:50.005
I know you're like, it all sounds magic, doesn't it?

17
00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:51.009
Yeah, it does.

18
00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:54.005
But like Arthur C. Clark said, any sufficiently

19
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:59.001
advanced technology is simply undistinguishable from magic.

20
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:02.006
These machines are becoming 24 hours, seven assistants

21
00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.007
ready to perform a variety of tasks for us, resulting

22
00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:12.000
in the manifestation of our vision almost in real time.

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.008
By training on large data sets, we can reduce the burden

24
00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:21.000
of repetitive tasks and complex computations, enabling us to

25
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.003
focus on more creative and more strategic activities

26
00:01:25.003 --> 00:01:30.008
which is the very essence of what work is really about.

27
00:01:30.008 --> 00:01:33.009
The development of generative AI has a very rich

28
00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.003
and very fascinating history marked

29
00:01:36.003 --> 00:01:39.003
by significant breakthroughs, even though it

30
00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:43.005
gained widespread attention in 2022, its evolution was built

31
00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:47.001
on decades of mathematical research,

32
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:51.003
starting with auto encoder neural networks in 2006

33
00:01:51.003 --> 00:01:53.009
and continuing on through the mass adoption

34
00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.008
of generative AI models like DALL E, ChatGPT by Open ai,

35
00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:03.001
Kubrick, Journey and others today.

36
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:06.008
Not only have the providers and services expanded

37
00:02:06.008 --> 00:02:10.002
but the quality of what is being produced has

38
00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:12.009
improved drastically as well.

39
00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:16.005
Like you can see in this chart by our world in data

40
00:02:16.005 --> 00:02:18.006
the exponential improvement in the quality

41
00:02:18.006 --> 00:02:23.007
of images generated between 2014 and 2022.

42
00:02:23.007 --> 00:02:27.000
While the pictures in 2014 are black and white

43
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.001
and extremely pixelated.

44
00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:32.000
In 2022, we would simply

45
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.009
type any word on the screen and generate coherent outcomes.

46
00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:40.004
Generative AI is not only changing almost

47
00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:43.005
every single profession, but it is also changing

48
00:02:43.005 --> 00:02:47.000
our understanding of what work is.

49
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.008
Large parts of the production process that are repetitive

50
00:02:50.008 --> 00:02:54.008
or can be computational are now starting to be facilitated

51
00:02:54.008 --> 00:02:56.007
by AI models.

52
00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:59.004
All of this leads to the chance

53
00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:03.002
we are given to discover the essence

54
00:03:03.002 --> 00:03:08.001
of what it means to be a human and the true meaning of work.

55
00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:11.008
A beautiful new existence awaits us where we focus

56
00:03:11.008 --> 00:03:16.007
on what makes us unique as a species, our curiosity,

57
00:03:16.007 --> 00:03:19.001
our conscious awareness, our dreams,

58
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.002
our emotional intelligence, and our vision

59
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:27.009
while the algorithms we have created assist us

60
00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:32.005
in the production and the execution of our authentic vision.
